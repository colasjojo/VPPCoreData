# VPPCoreData 

VPPCoreData library simplifies the task of managing data with Core Data 
framework. This library offers an automatic setup of Core Data and a set of
methods to set and retrieve data, both in foreground and background.
 
This library depends on `CoreData` framework and also on the included 
`SynthesizeSingleton` library, made by Matt Gallagher.

This project contains a sample application using it. Just open the project in 
XCode, build it and run it.
